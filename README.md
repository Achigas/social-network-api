## General info
This application uses MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the unstructured data of a social network website. User information can be created, updated, and deleted and users can post thoughts. These thoughts can be created, updated, and deleted and can have reactions by other users. Users can also add and delete freinds. 

## User Story
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
